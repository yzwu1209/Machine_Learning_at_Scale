    "### Q1 Student Answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> __a)__ Hadoop MapReduce is based on the functional programing paradigm. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function. Key ideas in this paradigm include avoiding state changes/mutable data, and using higher-order functions (functions which take other functions as inputs). MapReduce exemplifies these ideas through two phases: 'map' which applies a transformation(or filter) to all elements of a collection, and 'reduce' which aggregates/folds the elements of a collection. Map and reduce are examples of higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Hadoop Shuffle is a process of transferring data from the mappers to reducers: the partitioner determines which reducer will be responsible for processing a particular key, and the execution framework uses this information to copy the data to the right location. It happens after 'map' phase and before 'reduce' phase. When data volume is large, it could lead to an excessive amount of across-the-network copy operations, as well as the time complexity of doing a merge sort at scale. We could apply local aggregation of intermediate results in memory in mappers or by using a combiner to reduce the amount of data to be transferred from mappers to reducers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ Since Hadoop does not guarantee that a combiner will be executed, our record for- mat has to work whether or not it goes through the combiner. In other words, the signature of the input and output of the combiner must match the signature of the input to the reducer. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ We can control the level of parrallelization by specifying the number of reducers (through `-numReduceTasks` variable), but we cannot specify the number of mappers. The number of mappers is usually driven by the total size of the inputs, that is, the total number of blocks of the input files. The right level of parallelism for maps seems to be around 10-100 maps per-node, although it has been set up to 300 maps for very cpu-light map tasks. In terms of reducer, the ideal reducers should be the optimal value that gets them closest to:\n",
    "   - Should process  multiples of the block size \n",
    "   - A task time between 5 and 15 minutes  \n",
    "   - Creates the fewest files possible   \n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ Both of the following two changes prompted the creation of parallel computation frameworks:\n",
    "   - Opportunities for computing hardware improvement became diminishing. In addition, its returns no longer justified continued investment. \n",
    "   - Cheaper and cheaper hardware: rather than investing to build a super power computer, it is possible to and more sensible to build a network of less powerful computers. \n",
    "   - Substantial growth of large-data problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "> __a)__ Hadoop provides a lightweight API for constructs called “counters”, which can be used for counting events that occur during execution, e.g., number of corrupt records, number of times a certain condition is met, or anything that the programmer desires. It is a shared variable that is incremented and decremented atomically by the Hadoop framework. However, they are write-only variable and can only be read by log after the job is completed. They are useful in that \n",
    "   - (1) it provides a way to track the occurrences of global events within the map and reduce phases of jobs; \n",
    "   - (2) it is one of the easiest way to investigate internal behaviors of MapReduce programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hadoop built-in counter consists of three types:\n",
    "   - MapReduce Task Counters: This counter collects tasks information over the course of their execution. Then aggregate results over all the tasks. For example, MAP_INPUT_RECORDS counter counts the input records read by each map task and aggregates over all map tasks in a job. \n",
    "   - File System Counter: File system counters track 2 main details, the number of bytes read by the file system and a number of bytes written.\n",
    "   - Job Counter: Jobtracker maintain Job Counters, such as, TOTAL_LAUNCHED_MAPS. \n",
    "\n",
    "> We can create custom counter by specifying the following formatted line to the standard error stream: `reporter: counter: group, counter, amount`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Composite key contains more than one fields to form the key for Hadoop to shuffle. It is useful when we want to sort not just by the key but also by value, for instance, we might want to sort the words by their count to find the most frequent words but then break ties by the word in alphabetical order. By controlling how keys are sorted and how the key space is partitioned, we can present data to the reducer in the order necessary to perform the proper computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ Sometimes we need to calculate relative frequencies of co-occurring terms, which is calculated by $f(B|A)= \\frac{count(A \\cap B)}{count(A)}$. The “order inversion” design pattern is to control the order in which the total (count(A,$*$)) to come out first in the reducers stream by using a special key; so if the reducer receives this total first, then it can read each co-occurring pair and do the relative frequency calculation one by one. This design pattern resolve potential out-of-memory issue at the reducers or a second shuffle. To implement this, we need to get the word count first, and emit the key value of (A, $*$), because it will be alphabetically sorted before (A,aardvark) and other co-ocurring terms.\n",

    "# Question 3: Understanding Total Order Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge in distributed computing is to break a problem into a set of sub-problems that can be performed without communicating with each other. Ideally, we should be able to define an arbirtary number of splits and still get the right result, but that is not always possible. Parallelization becomes particularly challenging when we need to make comparisons between records, for example when sorting. Total Order Sort allows us to order large datasets in a way that enables efficient retrieval of results. Before beginning this assignment, make sure you have read and understand the [Total Order Sort Notebook](https://github.com/UCB-w261/main/tree/master/HelpfulResources/TotalSortGuide/_total-sort-guide-spark2.01-JAN27-2017.ipynb). You can skip the first two MRJob sections, but the rest of section III and all of section IV are **very** important (and apply to Hadoop Streaming) so make sure to read them closely.

    "\n",
    "> __a)__ **Partial-Sort** - The reducer output will be lot of (partition) files, each of which contains key-value records that are sorted within each partition file based on the key. Each partition file is sorted independently of each other. Concatentating such partitions would result in an unsorted file. **Total-Sort-(Unorderd-Partitions)** - Total sort refers to an ordering of all key-value pairs based upon a specified key. This total ordering will run across all output partition files unlike the partial sort described above. One caveat here is that there is no guarantee about which chunk of output is where, therefore partition files will need to be re-stacked to generate a total ordering.  **Total-Sort-(Ordered-Partitions)** - Total sort where the partition file names are also assigned in order which guarantees that the top N results will end up in the first partition. Concatentaing these files would result in a single completely sorted file witout any further intervention. The total order sort is important for large datasets because it would be time consuming to check all of the paritions to find the subset of the results you need. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ The shuffle and sort phase is leveraged to implement total order sort, which is after 'map' phase and before 'reduce' phase. We need to override Hadoop default behavior, such as Hadoop performs a partial sort on mapper output keys by alphanumerically increasing order, i.e. within each partition keys are sorted. Because in total order sort, we not only want the records to be sorted within each partition, we also want records to be sorted among all partitions such that the top records end up in the first partition. Therefore, we need to include a partition function to instruct Hadoop how to partition records. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ Overall we need to make the following modifications:\n",
    "- Modification 1: Include a partition file or partition function inside mappers. In a multi-reducer setup, an additional \"partition key\" is needed to instruct Hadoop how to partition records, and pass through the original (key, value) pair. \n",
    "- Modification 2: Drop internal partition key inside reducers. Because we have two keys - one for partitioning and the other for sorting, the reducer needs to drop the partition key which is used internally to aid total sort, and recover the original (key, value) pairs.\n",
    "- Modification 3: Post-processing step to order partitions. Because Hadoop makes no attempt to sort partition keys – the mapping between partition key and partition index is not order-preserving. Therefore, a post-processing step is required to finish total sort. We will need to take one record from every (non-empty) partition output, sort them, and construct the appropriate ordering among partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Specifically through the following command lines:\n",
    "```stream.num.map.output.key.fields\n",
    "stream.map.output.field.separator\n",
    "mapreduce.partition.keypartitioner.options\n",
    "KeyFieldBasedComparator\n",
    "keycomparator.options\n",
    "partitioner org.apache.hadoop.mapred.lib.KeyFieldBasedPartitioner```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ By default, Hadoop uses a library class `HashPartitioner` to compute the partition index for keys produced by mappers. In order to preserve partition key ordering, we will construct an \"inverse hashCode function\", which takes as input the desired partition index and total number of partitions, and returns a partition key. This key, when supplied to the Hadoop framework (KeyBasedPartitioner), will hash to the correct partition index.  \n",
    "\n",

    "# Question 4:  Enron Ham/Spam EDA.\n",
    "Before building our classifier, lets get aquainted with our data. In particular, we're interested in which words occur more in spam emails than in real emails. In this question you'll implement two Hadoop MapReduce jobs to count and sort word occurrences by document class. You'll also learn about two new Hadoop streaming parameters that will allow you to control how the records output of your mappers are partitioned for reducing on separate nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "__`IMPORTANT NOTE:`__ For this question and all subsequent items, you should include both the subject and the body of the email in your analysis (i.e. concatetate them to get the 'text' of the document).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) code:__ Complete the missing components of the code in __`EnronEDA/mapper.py`__ and __`EnronEDA/reducer.py`__ to create a Hadoop MapReduce job that counts how many times each word in the corpus occurs in an email for each class. Pay close attention to the data format specified in the docstrings of these scripts _-- there are a number of ways to accomplish this task, we've chosen this format to help illustrate a technique in `part e`_. Run the provided unit tests to confirm that your code works as expected then run the provided Hadoop streaming command to apply your analysis to the Enron data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) code + short response:__ How many times does the word \"__assistance__\" occur in each class? (`HINT:` Use a `grep` command to read from the results file you generated in '`a`' and then report the answer in the space provided.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ Would it have been possible to add some sorting parameters to the Hadoop streaming command that would cause our `part a` results to be sorted by count? Briefly explain why or why not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) code + short response:__ Write a second Hadoop MapReduce job to sort the output of `part a` first by class and then by count. Run your job and save the results to a local file. Then describe in words how you would go about printing the top 10 words in each class given this sorted output. (`HINT 1:` _remember that you can simply pass the `part a` output directory to the input field of this job; `HINT 2:` since this task is just reodering the records from `part a` we don't need to write a mapper or reducer, just use `/bin/cat` for both_)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code:__ A more efficient alternative to '`grep`-ing' for the top 10 words in each class would be to use the Hadoop framework to separate records from each class into its own partition so that we can just read the top lines in each. Edit your job from ` part d` to specify 2 reduce tasks and to tell Hadoop to partition based on the second field (which indicates spam/ham in our data). Your code should maintain the secondary sort -- that is each partition should list words from most to least frequent."

    "> __c)__ No, we can’t sort on counts in the original job because Hadoop’s sorting occurs in the phase between the mapper and reducer but our counts aren’t tallied up until after the reducer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ I would partition the results based on class, i.e. class 0 records go to one partition file, and class 1 records go to the other partition file. From there, we get the top 10 words from each partition file. We could also grep for the class marker that is listed in the second field."

However with much longer documents (eg. books) we might want a higher level of parallelization -- for example we might want to process parts of a document on different nodes. In this hypothetical scenario how would our algorithm design change? What could the mappers still do? What key-value structure would they emit? What would the reducers have to do as a last step?"

    "> __a)__ See response below:\n",
    "- __Keys__ are the words appear in the training data corpus, specifically in our trained model, they are, beijing, chinese, tokyo, shanghai, ClassPriors, japan, macao; \n",
    "- __Values__ are the following numbers, count in class 0, count in class 1, P(w|class0), P(w|class1).\n",
    "- __ClassPriors__ record means slightly different than other records, as it is not a word in the corpus, but rather a summary line for the two classes to show their total counts and prior probabilities. \n",
    "- The first two numeric fields (count in class 0, count in class 1) are not needed to perform inference but helpful for debugging. They are the counts for each word appearing in the two classes, NotChina and China respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ We choose to use log probabilities because:\n",
    "- First of all, we do not care about absolute probability, but rather a relative one for comparison;\n",
    "- With many conditional probabilities are multiplied, it could result in a floating point underflow.\n",
    "- By adding logarithms of probabilities instead of multiplying probabilities, the class with the highest log probability score is still the most probable. \n",
    "- If we use unsmoothed model, we could run into $log(0)$ which is undefined, and not a real number mathematically. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ We should add in Laplace smoothing, where we should set pseudocount $\\alpha > 0$. We could either assign the same conditional probability to each class or we could simply disregard that word. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ It slightly departs from functional programming principles. However it is ok since we’re not updating that state at all after it gets loaded on each mapper node so there’s no risk of a race condition. So the model file essentially is like a function where the output value of our model depends only on the arguments that are passed to our model. In addition, we do not share any information that needs to be updated across multiple nodes. From a scalability perspective, the use of \"in memory join\" is justified when the input/output of the join is small enough to fit the memory. Otherwise, we would need to use different approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ Complete the coding portion of this question before answering 'f'.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __f)__ If the documents get long enough that they no longer fit the memory, we would need to process parts of each document in parallel. Then the mapper should no longer be responsible for adding the log of the class priors (because that would end up getting added multiple times-- once for each mapper that encounters a piece of the same document). Our new mapper could still perform the conditional probability look-ups (emitting `DocID \\t log(P(word|class0)),log(P(word|class1)`). Then the reducers would add the log probabilities of all the words associated with each document (from all the mappers that processed a piece of that document) and then add the ClassPriors to make a final inference.\n"

    "* __a) train/test split:__ Run the provided code to split our Enron file into a training set and testing set then load them into HDFS. \n",
    "\n",
    "[`NOTE:` _Make sure you re calculate the vocab size for just the training set!_]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) train 2 models:__ Write Hadoop Streaming jobs to train MNB Models on the training set with and without smoothing. Save your models to local files at __`NaiveBayes/Unsmoothed/NBmodel.txt`__ and __`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.txt`__. [`NOTE:` _This naming is important because we wrote our classification task so that it expects a file of that name... if this inelegance frustrates you there is an alternative that would involve a few adjustments to your code [read more about it here](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-11-23)._] Finally run the checks that we provide to confirm that your results are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Recall that we designed our classification job with just a mapper. An efficient way to report the performance of our models would be to simply add a reducer phase to this job and compute precision and recall right there. Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/evaluation_reducer.py`__ and then write Hadoop jobs to evaluate your two models on the test set. Report their performance side by side. [`NOTE:` if you need a refresher on precision, recall and F1-score [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is a good resource.]\n",

We'll do this by writing a Hadoop job that sorts the model file (`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.py`). Normally we'd have to run two jobs -- one that sorts on $P(word|ham)$ and another that sorts on $P(word|spam)$. However if we slighly modify the data format in the model file then we can get the top words in each class with just one job. We've written a mapper that will do just this for you. Read through __`NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py`__ and then briefly explain how this mapper will allow us to partition and sort our model file. Write a Hadoop job that uses our mapper and `/bin/cat` for a reducer to partition and sort. Print out the top 10 words in each class (where 'top' == highest conditional probability).[`HINT:` _this should remind you a lot of what we did in Question 6._]\n",

How would increasing the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the probabilities for the top words that you identified for 'e'. How would they affect the probabilities of words that occur much more in one class than another? In summary, how does the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the bias and the variance of our model. [`NOTE:` _you do not need to code anything for this task, but if you are struggling with it you could try changing 'k' and see what happens to the test set. We don't recommend doing this exploration with the Enron data because it will be harder to see the impact with such a big vocabulary_]"

    "### Q9 Student Answers:\n",
    "> __d)__ A lot of the unsmoothed results end up with `-inf` probability for both Spam and Ham classes, which makes it hard to evaluate exactly which class to be predict. I think it is caused by words in test data that are unseen in train data. Without smoothing, the conditional probabilities would be zero, which leads to `-inf` for the log probabilities in our prediction results. In our case, I think the counts of TP, TN, FP and FN are most relevant, because from these counts we can see that the unsmoothed model seems to always predict 'negative' (TN and FN numbers are high). Recall that in our `classify_mapper.py`, we set the prediction rule as `if logpHam >= logpSpam: pred_class = 0; else: pred_class = 1`, since we have a lot of `-inf` in our log probabilities in our test cases based off unsmoothed model, most documents would be end up as negative in our predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ Please note that the __NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py__ has been modified to fix bugs in the results. This mapper adds two new fields to our model file: the first is the predicted class (`maxClass`), and the second one is the higher conditional probability (`maxClassP`). This mapper partitions on the predicted class such that 'ham' records go to one reducer and 'spam' records go to the other one. Then the hadoop job uses the second field `maxClassP` to sort the records within each reducer.   \n",
    "\n",
    "> __f)__ I notice that the 'top words' printed in __e__ for both classes are some common words from which we cannot really tell the whether it is a spam or not. Increasing the smoothing parameter k will generally cause the conditional probabilities in each class to be closer to each other. Therefore, it will have a larger effect on words that occcured much more in one class than the other. In other words increasing k reduces the variance of our model and thus make our model more generalizable. However, it could increase the bias of our model because as k increases our predictions are more likely to reflect the Class Priors."
