# Homework 3: Synonym Detection in Spark

This will be your first assignment in Spark. Please be sure to have reviewed all the material from the Week 4 and 5 Live Demos and assigned readings as this homework assumes you have a working familiarity with Spark RDDs. Your work consists of 8 questions in **`hw3_Workbook.ipynb`**. Please be sure to read all docstrings and inline comments closely. We will only grade code written in the designated spaces. If a question's instructions are unclear, please reach out for clarification on Slack. We expect each student to write their own code but collaboration without code sharing is encouraged.

### How to submit your work:
**This assignment is due on the Wednesday before Live Session 6**. Submit your work by pushing your completed notebook and supplemental files to your assigned student repository on Git. The file structure should look like this:
```
<prefix>-<user>
    --Assignments
        --HW1
        --HW2
        --HW3
           |__hw3_workbook.ipynb
           |__ etc ...
     --HelpfulResources
     --LiveSessionMaterials
     etc..
```

### Environment:
**This assignment can be completed locally. We strongly suggest that you use the course Docker container.** 

### Tips:
* Make use of your peers and TAs by asking questions on Slack. Everyone comes to MIDs from a different background so don't be shy; all questions are welcome!
