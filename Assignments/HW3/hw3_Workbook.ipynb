    "# HW 3 - Synonym Detection In Spark\n",
    "__`MIDS w261: Machine Learning at Scale | UC Berkeley School of Information | Fall 2018`__\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last homework assignment you performed Naive Bayes to classify documents as 'ham' or 'spam.' In doing so, we relied on the implicit assumption that the list of words in a document can tell us something about the nature of that document's content. We'll rely on a similar intuition this week: the idea that, if we analyze a large enough corpus of text, the list of words that appear in small window before or after a vocabulary term can tell us something about that term's meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be your first assignment working in Spark. You'll perform Synonym Detection by repurposing an algorithm commonly used in Natural Language Processing to perform document similarity analysis. In doing so you'll also become familiar with important datatypes for efficiently processing sparse vectors and a number of set similarity metrics (e.g. Cosine, Jaccard, Dice). By the end of this homework you should be able to:  \n",
    "* ... __define__ the terms `one-hot encoding`, `co-occurrance matrix`, `stripe`, `inverted index`, `postings`, and `basis vocabulary` in the context of both synonym detection and document similarity analysis.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ the reasoning behind using a word stripe to compare word meanings.\n",
    "* ... __identify__ what makes set-similarity calculations computationally challenging.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ stateless algorithms in Spark to build stripes, inverted index and compute similarity metrics.\n",
    "* ... __apply__ appropriate metrics to assess the performance of your synonym detection algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__`NOTE`__: your reading assignment for weeks 5 and 6 were fairly heavy and you may have glossed over the papers on dimension independent similarity metrics by [Zadeh et al](http://stanford.edu/~rezab/papers/disco.pdf) and pairwise document similarity by [Elsayed et al](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~oard/pdf/acl08elsayed2.pdf). If you haven't already, this would be a good time to review those readings -- they are directly relevant to this assignment.\n",

    "### Q1 Student Answers:\n",
    "> __a)__ Spark is a unified and optimized computing engine that supports general execution graphs over an RDD, and a set of libraries for parrallel data processing on computer clusters. It is considered the third generation of MapReduce programming model, whereas Hadoop is considered as the first generation. Spark is compatible with Apache Hadoop. What sets Spark apart from MapReduce-like frameworks is that in Spark the same worker nodes are reused across iterations. The workers hold onto the cached variables and reuse them without reading from the file system or re-receiving from the master. In comparison, standard MapReduce (consequently, Hadoop) does not support multi-stage jobs, so the only way of supporting iterative jobs is to store results in the file system at the end of every iteration and read stored results in the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ (1) In Spark, the core data structures are immutable, meaning for example, transformation always generates a new record in a new RDD. Input data are never modified. (2) RDDs can be cached for future use. Workers communicate with other workers to share cached and shuffled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__  In Spark, DAG is Directed Acyclic Graph. Operations assembled into a pipeline are organized as a DAG. It is an execution plan of transformations, a set of instructions that are used to construct a particular pipeline. This acts as a means of fault tolerance and optimization. Spark keeps track of a DAG that contains the list of transformations needed to recreate each RDD and only actually performs those transformations when an action is called. From DAG, we can see exactly how Spark executes the transformations. Sometimes, input commands may be different, however, their underlying DAGs may be the same. Through analyzing DAGs, we could also compare the efficiency of different commands.   \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ For example, to create an RDD requires multiple operations, and at the same time, this RDD needs to be accessed repeated for other operations, such as running an iterative algorithm like random forests. In this case, we would want to cache() an RDD. Cache()-ing makes sense when an intermediate result will be used in multiple downstream transformations. It would avoid repeating computation and improve efficiency.   \n",

    "# Question 2: Similarity Metrics\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction to this assignment, an intuitive way to compare the meaning of two documents is to compare the list of words they contain. Given a vocabulary $V$ (feature set) we would represent each document as a vector of `1`-s and `0`-s based on whether or not it contains each word in $V$. These \"one-hot encoded\" vector representations allow us to use math to identify similar documents. However like many NLP tasks the high-dimensionality of the feature space is a challenge... especially when we start to scale up the size and number of documents we want to compare.\n",

    "# Question 3: Synonym Detection Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Synonym Detection task we want to compare the meaning of words, not documents. For clarity, lets call the words whose meaning we want to compare `terms`. If only we had a 'meaning document' for each `term` then we could easily use the document similarity strategy from Question 2 to figure out which `terms` have similar meaning (i.e. are 'synonyms'). Of course in order for that to work we'd have to reasonably believe that the words in these 'meaning documents' really do reflect the meaning of the `term`. For a good analysis we'd also need these 'meaning documents' to be fairly long -- the one or two sentence dictionary definition of a term isn't going to provide enough signal to distinguish between thousands and thousands of `term` meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the idea of co-occurrance comes in. Just like DocSim makes the assumption that words in a document tell us about the document's meaning, we're going to assume that the set of words that 'co-occur' within a small window around our term can tell us some thing about the meaning of that `term`. Remember that we're going to make this 'co-words' list (a.k.a. 'stripe') by looking at a large body of text. This stripe is our 'meaning document' in that it reflects all the kinds of situations in which our `term` gets used in real language. So another way to phrase our assumption is: we think `terms` that get used to complete lots of the same phrases probably have related meanings. This may seem like an odd assumption but computational linguists have found that it works surprisingly well in practice. Let's look at a toy example to build your intuition for why and how.\n",

    "> __a)__ In total we want to compare 15 pairs, which is $\\frac{6*5}{2} = 15$. More generally, we need to make $\\frac{n*(n-1)}{2}$ comparisons for a n-word vocabulary. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ There are 36 entries in this matrix, 28 of them are zero.    \n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ `best-worst` and `foolishness-wisdom` have the highest similarity scores. They are not 'synonyms' in the traditional sense. They are only similar in terms of their neighboring words. It happens that two pairs of antonyms are put in symmetric sentenses. Since we only have a small corpus of input text, thes two pairs of words end up having the same neighboring words, which makes their vectors the same, and thus the highest score. If we would have a larger corpus, we may be able to see more variations in the neighboring words for each word.    "

    "# Question 4: Pairs and Stripes at Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "As you read in the paper by Zadeh et al, the advantage of metrics like Cosine, Dice, Overlap and Jaccard is that they are dimension independent -- that is to say, if we implement them in a smart way the computational complexity of performing these computations is independent of the number of documents we want to compare (or in our case, the number of terms that are potential synonyms). One component of a 'smart implementation' involves thinking carefully both about how you define the \"basis vocabulary\" that forms your feature set (removing stopwords, etc). Another key idea is to use a data structure that facilitates distributed calculations. The DISCO implemetation further uses a sampling strategy, but that is beyond the scope of this assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question we'll take a closer look at the computational complexity of the synonym detection approach we took in question 3 and then revist the document similarity example as a way to explore a more efficient approach to parallelizing this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4 Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ In question 3 you calculated the cosine similarity of pairs of words using the vector representation of their co-occurrences in a corpus. Imagine for now that you have unlimited memory on each of your nodes and describe a sequence of map & reduce steps that would start from a raw corpus and reproduce your strategy from Q3. For each step be sure to note what information would be stored in memory on your nodes and what information would need to be shuffled over the network (a bulleted list of steps with 1-2 sentences each is sufficient to answer this question).\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ In the asynch videos about \"Pairs and Stripes\" you were introduced to an alternative strategy. Explain two ways that using these data structures are more efficient than 1-hot encoded vectors when it comes to distributed similarity calculations [__`HINT:`__ _Consider memory constraints, amount of information being shuffled, amount of information being transfered over the network, and level of parallelization._]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) read provided code:__ The code below provides a streamined implementation of Document similarity analysis in Spark. Read through this code carefully. Once you are confident you understand how it works, answer the remaining questions. [__`TIP:`__ _to see the output of each transformation try commenting out the subsequent lines and adding an early `collect()` action_.]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ The second mapper function, `splitWords`, emits 'postings'. The list of all 'postings' for a word is also refered to as an 'inverted index'. Define each of these terms based on your reading of the provided code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) short response:__ The third mapper, `makeCompositeKeys`, loops over the inverted index to emit 'pairs' of what? Explain what information is included in the composite key created at this stage and why it makes sense to synchronize around that information in the context of performing document similarity calculations. In addition to the information included in these new keys, what other piece of information will we need to compute Jaccard or Cosine similarity?\n",

    "### Q4 Student Answers:\n",
    "> __a)__ Q3 strategies are summarized below:\n",
    "- We loop through raw corpus to construct a set of vocabulary (distinct words in our corpus, excluding stop words). The vocabulary should be stored in memory and shuffle over the network;\n",
    "- Loop through each vocabulary to get their neighboring words an contruct a dictionary of stripes. The stripes should be stored in memory and shuffled over the network. \n",
    "- Based on the stripes, fill in the 1-hot encoded co-occurrence matrix. The matrix should be stored in memory and shuffled over the network. \n",
    "- Calcuate cosine similarity scores for each column in the co-occurrence matrix, and save the scores for each word pair into a dictionary. The result dictionary would be be stored in memory and shuffled over the network. \n",
    "- In summary, in order for this naive approach to work, there is a lot of data that needs to be stored in memory and shuffled over the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ (1) For '__pair__' strategy, each mapper takes a sentence and generate all co-occurring term pairs; for all pairs, emit (a, b) and count; then combiners/reducers sum up counts associated with these pairs; each pair corresponds to a cell in the word co-occurrence matrix. It uses complex keys in order to coordinate distributed computations. (2) For '__stripe__' strategy, each mapper takes a sentence and generates all co-occurring term pairs; for each term, emits a → { b: countb , c: countc , d: countd ...}; then reducers perform element-wise sum of associative arrays. It has far less sorting and shuffling of key-value pairs. Both approaches require less data to be stored in memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ _read provided code before answering d-f_ \n",

    "- __doc__: the document name, in our case, it would be `docA`, `docB`, etc.\n",

    "- A postings list is comprised of individual postings, each of which consists of a document id and a payload—information about occurrences of the term in the document. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ The `makeCompositeKeys` emits 'pairs' of documents that have the same word. The composite key created at this stage includes document name and its number of words, for example `\"(('docA', 4), ('docB', 4))\"`. In the context of performing document similarity calculations, we need to know the total number of words for each document, therefore it makes sense to synchronize around this information. In addition, we also need the total count of words that each pair of document share (the count of $|A\\cap B|$ part) to compute Jaccard or Cosine similarity.   \n",

Specifically, we need a large enough corpus of natural language that we can expose our algorithm to a realistic range of contexts in which in any given word might get used. Ideally, these 'contexts' would also provide enough signal to distinguish between words with similar semantic roles but different meaning. Finding such a corpus will be easier to accomplish for some words than others.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every word that appears in our data is a potential feature for our synonym detection analysis. However as we've discussed, some are likely to be more useful than others. In this question, you'll choose a judicious subset of these words to form our 'basis vocabulary' (i.e. feature set). Practically speaking, this means that when we build our stripes, we are only going to keep track of when a term co-occurs with one of these basis words. \n",

    "> __a)__ By choosing the 1000 most frequent words as basis vocabulary, we would only detect synonyms that co-occurs with words that have stongest signals in training set. Therefore, it may result in 'overfitting' a training set, because the top frequent words may just be more frequently seen in training set than in general document texts. On the other hand, choosing the 1000 least frequent words would result in 'underfitting' a training set. \n",

Some pairs usually appear together because they are common phrases/word combinations: verb plus adverbs, or adjective plus noun. One approach would be to increase the library of stop words. Another approach could be instead of looking at all 5-gram, words that sit right next to one another should be not be considered as 'neighbor', because most of time they would not be 'synonyms' but words that complement with each other as an expression.  \n"
